## Web Scratchpad

A simple website with learning and practice projects using Django, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

* /polls/ is a website made while following the [Django official tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/intro/tutorial01/).

* /calc/ is a simple web calculator made for practice.

To run locally, first ensure you have [python and Django installed](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/intro/install/). 

(You can check quickly by running `python` in your shell, and then `>>> import django` in Python's prompt.)

Then, `git clone https://github.com/erperreault/` and run `python manage.py runserver` from the base directory. Access the polls app at http://localhost:8000/polls, calc at http://localhost:8000/calc/, and admin features at http://localhost:8000/admin/.
